Texas A&M,MS in Computer Science,https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/degrees/ms-cs.html,https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/degrees/graduate/faq.html#status,"December 15 is the deadline for Ph.D. applications to be considered for Fall (September) admission. All applicants are considered for financial aid, without a separate financial aid application. The Master's application deadline is January 15 for Fall (September).
 
 While most students are admitted in the Fall, the department does consider a very small number of applicants for Spring admission. Applications for Spring (January) admission should be received by August 1. Applicants for Spring admission should understand that there will be few, if any, opportunities for fellowships and assistantships, since most are awarded in the Fall. There are no Summer admissions."
